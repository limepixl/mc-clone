# mc-clone
An attempt at making some sort of Minecraft clone in OpenGL using C++. It has limited functionality and is not an actual game, just a playable demo.

Things to do: 
* Chunk edge detection - faces on chunk edges are rendered regardless whether there's an adjacent block or not
* Block removal and placement
* Better randomized chunk generation for heighmap usage
